## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I already knew a little about grid and absolute and relative position, with this project I was able to fix it a little more in my mind.

### Continued development

I need to improve in grid and positions, I think I had a satisfactory result, but it can be improved a lot. I want to focus a lot on the grid as it is very good for positioning elements in the interface.

## Acknowledgments

I managed to do the mobile design without much difficulty, but this image in flexWrapper gave me a little headache, I have to improve my understanding of position. I think I got a satisfactory result as I was able to practice a lot with the grid in a real project.
